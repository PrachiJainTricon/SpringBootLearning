Primary Key generation Strategies :
There are Four type of it :-
1. GenerationType.AUTO : it tis default generation type.
- Hibernate as persistence provider selects gerneration strategy based on db-specific dialect.
- Most popular db selects SEQUENCE generationtype.\
- Note: hibernate create hibernate_seqence table to maintain the primary keys. in case of AUTO
ex:
@Id
@@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
2. GenerationType.IDENTITY : it relies on an auto-incremented db column and lets db generate a new value with each other operation.
- not good for jdbc batch operation.
3. GenerationType.SEQUENCE: default sequence is 50.
ex:
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO,
    generator="product_generator")

@SequenceGenerator(
    name = "product_generator",
    sequenceName = "product_sequence_name",
    allocationSize = 1)

4. GenerationType.TABLE


Difference between GenerationType.IDENTITY / GenerationType.SEQUENCE / GenerationType.AUTO
GenerationType.Identity does not create any additional sequence tables like GenerationType.AUTO / GenerationType.SEQUENCE and also maintain the sequences in every table starts from 0, rather than maintaining the sequence number across the tables like GenerationType.AUTO does it.
GenerationType.AUTO generates one more table named hibernate_sequences for maintaining the sequences.
GenerationType.SEQUENCE is purely customizable, probably every auto generation field would have configured with separate sequences
